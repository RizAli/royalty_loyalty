# Royalty Loyalty App

### STEMettes

There aren't enough girls going into Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics fields. It's a problem because there is currently a skills shortage, and if they are going to have any power or influence in today's and tomorrow's world, then girls will need to have a good grasp of STEM, what it involves and the roles available. STEMettes organizes various panel events, hackathons and exhibitions to meet women already working in STEM. In this project we as a team create a web app for our client STEMettes. 

A Makers Academy group project for [STEMettes](http://stemettes.org/) by

Beta version hosted on [heroku](https://stemettes-staging.herokuapp.com/)

We had two weeks to learn Rails and complete this project. We managed to include all the features that our client wanted. The application can be improved by adding some features such as geo location, barcode scanner to make it even more user friendly.

### Prupose of the app:
There are two sections in the app user interface and admin interface.

user-interface
This interface will be used by STEMettes girls to complete pre and post surveys and earn points. 

admin-interface
This interface will be used by organizers of the event to view responses of the event and perform some other admin tasks.
